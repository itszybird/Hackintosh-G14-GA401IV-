# Hackintosh-G14-GA401IV
MacOS 14.7.5 success with the G14 2020 Model

# Important
This page will never be updated, since it was supposed to be a side project I am working on.
Though I managed to get macOS on my laptop, I don't use it as much, so unless it stops working, 
I won't be updating the page.

# Note 
Best if someone forks this page and makes it support newer macOS updates!
