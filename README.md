# Important
This page will never be updated, since it was supposed to be a side project I am working on.<br>
Though I managed to get macOS on my laptop, I don't use it as much, so unless it stops working,<br> 
I won't be updating the page.
# Note 
Best if someone forks this page and makes it support newer macOS updates!<br>
